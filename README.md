# IEEE Fraud Detection

Can you detect fraud from customer transactions ?

[Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/overview)

## Prerequisites

- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) >=5.x

## Set up conda environment

```
conda create -n analytics python=3.6
conda activate analytics
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Kaggle API credentials

To use the [Kaggle client library](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api), sign up for a Kaggle account at https://www.kaggle.com. Then go to the 'Account' tab of your user profile (`https://www.kaggle.com/<username>/account`) and select 'Create API Token'. This will trigger the download of `kaggle.json`, a file containing your API credentials. Place this file in the location `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json` (on Windows in the location `C:\Users\<Windows-username>\.kaggle\kaggle.json`).

For your security, ensure that other users of your computer do not have read access to your credentials. On Unix-based systems you can do this with the following command:

`chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`
